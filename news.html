<h2 style="text-align:center;margin-top:3em">November 2019 APA Assembly Report</h2>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Robert Feder, M.D.<br />New Hampshire Assembly Rep</h4>
		
<ol type="I">
    <li>
        <strong>Finances</strong>
        <p>APA revenues and expenses for 2019 are expected to be essentially equal. Net assets were up due to good stock market performance in 2019.  There will be a significant expense in 2020 when the APA buys its new DC office space.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Membership</strong>
        <p>APA membership continues to grow, now above 39,000.  Despite this, income from membership is down due to aging membership. (Older members pay lower dues).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>President-Elect’s Comments</strong>
        <p>Jeffrey Geller indicated that a primary goal of his upcoming presidency will be to set up a task force to determine exactly how many psychiatric beds are needed in the United States, which currently no one knows.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>CEO’s Comments</strong>
        <p>Saul Levin discussed various recent accomplishments of the APA.  These included  1) The APA’s model parity and collaborative care laws starting to get passed in various states (these are on the docket in New Hampshire for the next legislative session)  2)  Increased payment (7%) and decreased documentation in Medicare for E/M codes scheduled to take effect in 2021 and 3) an app evaluation module which can be found on the APA website to help members evaluate new mental health phone apps.  Dr. Levin also expressed concern over the possible loss of 125 residency spots due to changes in the Uniformed Services University budget.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Assembly Actions</strong>
        <p>Assembly Action Papers were relatively light and uncontroversial this session.  The following notable papers were passed. These actions will still need to be approved by the APA Board before they become official APA policy.</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>That the APA improve the search engine on its website to make it more user-friendly</li>
            <li>That the APA NOT create an affiliate membership status for non-physicians (the Board has been considering this as a way of raising revenue)</li>
            <li>That the APA work with the Social Security Administration to ensure that chiropractors not be allowed to do mental health disability evaluations (this is already happening in Mississippi)</li>
            <li>That the APA work with two national pharmacy boards to start initiating patient education on safe disposal of unused medication at the time of any controlled substance prescription fill</li>
            <li>That the APA join as a signatory to the U.S. Call to Action on Climate, Health, and Equity.  Also, that the APA start monitoring and trying to reduce its carbon footprint</li>
            <li>A position statement that encourages the use of the Physician Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), involving physicians in determining parameters and sanctions regarding use, and protecting the confidentiality of information in PDMPs.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
